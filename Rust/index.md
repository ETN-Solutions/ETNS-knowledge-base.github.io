# Cargo
Cargo is the Rust build tool and package manager

When you install Rustup youâ€™ll also get the latest stable version of the Rust build tool and package manager, also known as Cargo. Cargo does lots of things:

- build your project with cargo build
- run your project with cargo run
- test your project with cargo test
- build documentation for your project with cargo doc
- publish a library to crates.io with cargo publish

To test that you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can run this in your terminal of choice:
```rs
cargo --version
```

## Generate new project
```rs
cargo new hello-rust
```

## Compile, generate and run rust executable
```rs
cargo run
```
