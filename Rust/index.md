# Cargo
Cargo is the Rust build tool and package manager

When you install Rustup youâ€™ll also get the latest stable version of the Rust build tool and package manager, also known as Cargo. Cargo does lots of things:

- Build your project with "cargo build"
- Run your project with "cargo run"
- Test your project with "cargo test"
- Build documentation for your project with "cargo doc"
- Publish a library to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) with "cargo publish"

To test that you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can run this in your terminal of choice:
```rs
cargo --version
```

## Hello world
// main.rs
```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello world!")
}
```

To compile this we type
```rs
rustc main.rs
```
This creates a rust executable which can be run by
```rs
./main
```

## Generate new project
```rs
cargo new hello-rust
```

## Compile, generate and run rust executable
```rs
cargo run
```
