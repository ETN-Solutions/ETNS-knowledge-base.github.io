# JsDocs

What is JsDocs?

JSDoc is a particular kind of code comment used in JavaScript to document your code by adding annotations. These annotations follow a specific syntax, and you can use them to specify the role of each variable, function, or method in your code, its input parameters, output, and any exceptions that may arise.
