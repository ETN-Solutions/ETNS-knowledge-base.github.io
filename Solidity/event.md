# Events
Events are an abstraction of the Ethereum logging/event-watching protocol. Log entries provide the contractâ€™s address, a series of up to four topics and some arbitrary length binary data. Events leverage the existing function ABI in order to interpret this (together with an interface spec) as a properly typed structure.

Given an event name and series of event parameters, we split them into two sub-series: those which are indexed and those which are not. Those which are indexed, which may number up to 3 (for non-anonymous events) or 4 (for anonymous ones), are used alongside the Keccak hash of the event signature to form the topics of the log entry. Those which are not indexed form the byte array of the event.

contract LearnEvents {
