## Operators

Solidity supports the following types of operators.

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Comparison Operators
3. Logical (or Relational) Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Conditional (or ternary) Operators

### Arithmetic operators

Solidity supports the following arithmetic operators
 
<table> 
  <tr><td> + (Addition)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>  - (Subtraction)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>  * (Multiplication)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>  / (Division)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>   % (Modulus)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>  ++ (Increment)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>  -- (Decrement)</td></tr>
</table>

### Comparison Operators

Solidity supports the following comparison operators

<table> 
  <tr><td>  = = (Equal)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>  != (Not Equal)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>   > (Greater than)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>  < (Less than)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>  >= (Greater than or Equal to)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>  <= (Less than or Equal to)</td></tr>
</table>

### Logical Operators

Solidity supports the following logical operators
<table>
<tr><td> && (Logical AND) </td></tr>
<tr><td> || (Logical OR) </td></tr>
<tr><td> ! (Logical NOT) </td></tr>
</table>

### Bitwise Operators

Solidity supports the following bitwise operators 

<table>
<tr><td> & (Bitwise AND)</td></tr>
<tr><td> | (BitWise OR)</td></tr>
<tr><td> ^ (Bitwise XOR)</td></tr>
<tr><td> ~ (Bitwise Not)</td></tr>
<tr><td> << (Left Shift)</td></tr>
<tr><td> >> (Right Shift)</td></tr>
<tr><td> >>> (Right shift with Zero)</td></tr>
</table>

### Assignment Operators

Solidity supports the following assignment operators

<table>
<tr><td> = (Simple Assignment )</td></tr>
<tr><td> += (Add and Assignment)</td></tr>
<tr><td> âˆ’= (Subtract and Assignment)</td></tr>
<tr><td> *= (Multiply and Assignment) </td></tr>
<tr><td> /= (Divide and Assignment)</td></tr>
<tr><td> %= (Modules and Assignment) </td></tr>
</table>

### Conditional Operator (? :)

The conditional operator first evaluates an expression for a true or false value and then executes one of the two given statements depending upon the result of the evaluation.
<table>
<tr><td> ? : (Conditional ) </td></tr>
</table>
