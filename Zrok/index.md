## What's a zrok?

zrok (/ziːɹɒk/ ZEE-rock) is a secure, open-source, self-hostable sharing platform that simplifies shielding and sharing network services or files. There's a hardened zrok-as-a-service offering available at zrok.io with a generous free tier.

## What's it for?

Use zrok to share a running service, like a web server or a network socket, or to share a directory of static files.

If sharing publicly, you can reserve a subdomain, enable authentication options, or both. Public shares proxy HTTPS to your service or files.

If sharing privately, only users with the share token can access your share. In addition to what you can share publicly, private shares can include TCP and UDP services.
